Project: Conway's Game of Life
Members: Will Dickinson and David Liu

Original Game
--------------
Conway's Game of Life is a simple simulation for life.
The game consists of 4 rules:
    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

 - Pause/Resume
 - Step
 - Pattern Selector
 - Color Selector
 - Responsive Design
