# DotA Matchmaking Simulator 2017
## I. High Concept
  A minigame about the emotional meta in the popular MOBA DotA 2. The game will consist of scenarios in which your team faces an emotional crisis in which you must determine the correct in-game response to boost your team's morale.
## II. Genre
  This game works similar to a trivia game in that it is text-based and you are given multiple options to choose from to respond to the question.
## III. Platform
  This will be a web-based game and all you need is a mouse.
## IV. Story
  You enter a game of DotA 2 through Valve's rigorous and balanced matchmaking algorithm. As you load in you examine your environemt. A toxic player here, a feeder there ... it doesn't look promising. However, you have trained for years through the positive mental attitude regimen and you understand what you must do to win. Only through high morale and your vast knowledge of the meme meta can you lead your team to victory.
## V. Aesthetics
  This game will have a grey background and options and keywords will be color-coded to align with certain themes. For example a negative response would be in red, while a more comedic response would be in yellow. There will also be a morale bar that is greed/red.
  I only want a very simple style that gets the experience across.
## VI. Gameplay
  ### Controls
  This game will be only using the mouse to click on things, but there is a slight possibility of having keyboard shortcuts for the options.
  ### Mechanics
  Players will be given specific scenarios that occur in a match of DotA 2. They will have to pick from 4 options to respond to the scenario in order to boost the morale of their team. The effectiveness of their response will be shown through a morale bar at the top of the screen. If this bar should turn all red then they will lose the game. If it fills with all green then they win. The scenarios will be randomized, but the responses to each scenario will follow a certain formula specific to the scenario. Each response will have a theme (comedic, uplifting, negative) and a scenario will have to have 4 responses that fit the given theme for that scenario. Basically the scenarios may be the same, but the responses will be slightly different each time.

## VIII. Other
  ### Sounds
  I aim to play some in-game sounds that correspond to the choices the player selects. I may also make my own sounds depending on the responses. Most of the sounds can be found on [the DotA 2 chatwheel page](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Chat_Wheel).
  ### Stretch Goals
  I would also like to have a matchmaking rating that gets carried over between games similar to how actual MOBAs work. I want it to accurately simulate the mental aspects of matchmaking.
